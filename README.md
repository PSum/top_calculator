# TOP_Calculator

This is a basic calculator. By finishing this project im going to finish the fundamentals course of the odin project.

## Status
The project is theoretically finished.
When displaying too long numbers (e.g. 3.145614), the calculator is not rounding them yet.
Other than that, all basic functionalitys are working yet.
